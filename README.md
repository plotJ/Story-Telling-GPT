# Story Telling App

## Overview
This Story Telling App is an interactive web application that generates custom stories based on user-defined characters, genres, and tones. It leverages local AI models to create unique narratives tailored to user preferences.

## Features
- Character Creation: Add, edit, and delete custom characters with names, descriptions, and personalities.
- Genre Selection: Choose from Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, or Sci-Fi genres.
- Tone Selection: Set the story's tone as Happy, Sad, Sarcastic, or Funny.
- AI-Powered Story Generation: Uses locally hosted AI models to create stories incorporating user-defined elements.
- Dark Mode Interface: Features a sleek, eye-friendly dark mode design.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- text-generation-webui (for local AI model hosting)

## Prerequisites
- [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) installed and set up
- A compatible AI model loaded in text-generation-webui

## Setup and Installation

1. Set up text-generation-webui:
   - Install text-generation-webui following the instructions in their GitHub repository.
   - Enable the "API" and "OpenAI" extensions in the Session tab.
   - Load a compatible language model.

2. Clone the Story Telling App repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/plotJ/Story-Telling-GPT
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd story-telling-app
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Usage
1. Ensure text-generation-webui is running with a model loaded.
2. Add characters using the character creation form in the app.
3. Select a genre and tone for your story.
4. Click "Generate Story" to create a unique narrative.
5. Read and enjoy your custom-generated story!


## Future Enhancements
- Implement comparison functionality between different AI models.
- Add options for adjusting generation parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.).
- Incorporate a feature to fine-tune models on custom datasets.
- Implement a system for users to rate and provide feedback on generated stories.
